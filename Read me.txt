This mod is simply a replace and retouch of the original hat files, so you can still find these hat by buying from the har house, and the tophat from the casino. 

How to install:
- Put hats.xnb in  Steam\SteamApps\common\Stardew Valley\Content\Characters\Farmer
- Make sure you back up the original file before you overwrite it!
- Enjoy!

Please do not reupload this any where else, or include, or edit these files or put it in other mods.
